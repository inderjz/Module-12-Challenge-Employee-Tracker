  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  Employee Tracker is my project. It can assist businesses in keeping tabs on their staff, management, and internal departments. It can also assist businesses in maintaining budget data for their businesses. There are other additional features as well, such as the ability to adjust positions and delete employees.

  This project was started by me in an effort to make it easier for businesses to manage their assets such as people and other items.

  This may be used by anybody to add the workers who work for their firm, assign managers to the employees, and reassign employees at any moment. Owners of businesses may also create new departments and budgets for such departments.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  Use the following instructions to make sure you have all the required technologies installed before using this project. 'npm I', 'npm I inquirer', 'npm I mysql', and 'npm I console.table' should be executed. Make sure to open SQL files in MySQL Workbench after executing all of the aforementioned instructions. To accomplish this, launch MySQL Workbench and, on MacOS, click on File, then choose Open SQL Script. After doing so, make sure you are in the project directory and that your server.js is connected to SQL by running "node server.js" on the terminal before moving on. Once you are connected to the SQL, you may proceed with prompts as necessary.
